Permanent TODO priorities:
- more and better examples
- documentation, commented code
======================

Configuration:
- search for INI file in all standard locations for a configuration file on different operating systems
- more INI file options
- more command line arguments for GUI configuration
- default values if INI file is missing or corrupt
- configuration interface using 'config' URL, HTML page and, when needed, 'restart' URL

Security:
- mandatory access control lists for Mongoose

Long-running scripts:
- check if long-running script is not already started
- check for STDERR from scripts, if any - display message
- independent settings for main window and long-running scripts window

Perl debugger interaction:
- option to display debugger output in HTML
- 'Save Page As' dialog to save debugger output in a file
- load modified debugger on Windows, which is capable of working without a console
  (using PERL5DB environment variable? http://perldoc.perl.org/perldebguts.html)

Extensibility:
- Mojolicious support - run Mojolicious scripts using morbo or hypnotoad Perl web servers

i18n:
- frameless QWebView-based message boxes
- i18n in all native dialogs
