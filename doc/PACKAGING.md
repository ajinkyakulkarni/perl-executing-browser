# Perl Executing Browser - Packaging

## Minimal Relocatable Perl Distribution for PEB

Minimizing the size of a relocatable (or portable) Perl distribution used by a PEB-based application is vital for reducing the size of its distribution package. [Perl Distribution Compactor](https://github.com/ddmitov/perl-executing-browser/blob/master/sdk/compactor.pl) is one solution for this problem. It finds all dependencies of all Perl scripts run by PEB and copies them in a new ``{PEB_executable_directory}/resources/app/perl/lib`` folder. Any unnecessary modules are left behind and the original ``bin`` and ``lib`` folders are saved as ``bin-original`` and ``lib-original``.  

Perl Distribution Compactor must be started from the ``{PEB_executable_directory}/sdk/lib`` folder using [compactor.sh](https://github.com/ddmitov/perl-executing-browser/blob/master/sdk/compactor.sh) on a Linux machine or [compactor.cmd](https://github.com/ddmitov/perl-executing-browser/blob/master/sdk/compactor.cmd) on a Windows machine to make sure that only a relocatable Perl distribution is used.  

Perl Distribution Compactor depends on [Module::ScanDeps](https://metacpan.org/pod/Module::ScanDeps) and [File::Copy::Recursive](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Copy::Recursive) CPAN modules, which are included in the ``{PEB_executable_directory}/sdk/lib`` directory.

## AppImage Support

* **PEB AppImage Maker**

  PEB or any PEB-based application can be easily packed as a 64-bit single-file Linux [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) executable by the [PEB AppImage Maker](https://github.com/ddmitov/perl-executing-browser/blob/master/sdk/appimage-maker.sh) script, which has two modes of operation:  

  * packing a Perl application together with a PEB executable, Qt libraries and a relocatable Perl distribution:  

    ```bash
    ./appimage-maker.sh --include-resources
    ```

    In this case, the PEB AppImage Maker invokes the [Perl Distribution Compactor](https://github.com/ddmitov/perl-executing-browser/blob/master/sdk/compactor.pl), which finds all dependencies of all Perl scripts in the ``{PEB_executable_directory}/resources/app`` directory and copies only the necessary Perl modules.

  * packing only a PEB executable and its Qt libraries:  

    ```bash
    ./appimage-maker.sh --no-resources
    ```

    In this case, a PEB executable from an AppImage will try to find its application files and folders in the directory of the AppImage.  

  In both modes of operation, the PEB AppImage uses the [linuxdeployqt](https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/releases/) tool to detect all Qt dependencies of PEB and build the final image.  

  The PEB AppImage Maker script must be started from the ``{PEB_executable_directory}/sdk`` directory.  

* **PEB AppImage Configuration Files**

  ``{PEB_executable_directory}/resources/app/{application_name}.desktop``  
  ``{PEB_executable_directory}/resources/app/{application_name}.appdata.xml``  

  ``{PEB_executable_directory}/resources/app/{application_name}.desktop``  
  is mandatory for any PEB-based application which will be packed by the PEB AppImage Maker.  
  A minimal example of Ð° ``.desktop`` file is available [here](https://github.com/ddmitov/perl-executing-browser/blob/master/resources/app/peb-demo.desktop).  
  ``Icon=app`` inside a ``.desktop`` file must not be changed for the proper display of the application icon.  
  All registered categories in a ``.desktop`` file are available [here](https://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html).  
  Any ``.desktop`` file can be validated using the ``desktop-file-validate`` tool from the  ``desktop-file-utils`` package in all major Linux distributions.  

  The [AppStream Generator](http://output.jsbin.com/qoqukof) of [probonopd](https://github.com/probonopd) is the recommended tool for generating AppStream ``.appdata.xml`` files for PEB-based applications. An example AppStream file is available [here](https://github.com/ddmitov/perl-executing-browser/blob/master/resources/app/peb-demo.appdata.xml). An AppStream file is not mandatory, but is highly recommended.  

  Both PEB AppImage configuration files are put on their places in the AppImage directory tree structure by the PEB AppImage Maker script.  

* **PEB AppImage Builder Docker Container**

  An easy building environment for PEB AppImage executables is the [PEB AppImage Builder Docker Container](https://github.com/ddmitov/perl-executing-browser/blob/master/sdk/Dockerfile).  
  To build it, type the following command in the PEB project root directory (the directory of the README.md):  

  ```bash
  sudo docker build -t peb-appimage-builder .
  ```

  To start the PEB AppImage Builder Docker Container, type the following command in the PEB project root directory:  

  ```bash
  sudo docker container run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/opt --user $(id -u):$(id -g) peb-appimage-builder
  ```

  When PEB AppImage Builder Docker Container is running, type:

  ```bash
  cd /opt/sdk
  ```

  To start the PEB AppImage Maker, type either:

  ```bash
  ./appimage-maker.sh --no-resources
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  ./appimage-maker.sh --include-resources
  ```

Perl Executing Browser is also listed at the [AppImageHub](https://appimage.github.io/perl-executing-browser/).  
Any authors of PEB-based Linux applications are encouraged to list their AppImage executables in the same manner.
